ConnectAnyThing
============

# Overview

ConnectAnyThing is an easy tool for real-time electronic tinkering on Galileo using a mobile device.

0) Download ConnectAnyThing [here](https://github.com/IntelOpenDesign/ConnectAnyThing/releases).

1) Put the ConnectAnyThing software onto a Galileo’s SD card, and power on.

2) Galileo broadcasts a Wi-Fi network called “ConnectAnyThing.” Join with your mobile device.

3) Open a web browser on your device, go to "cat.com". The webpage lets you read inputs and control outputs in real-time from your mobile device.

Good for tinkering, classroom activities, testing sensors, etc.

## How To Set Up ConnectAnyThing

### Hardware Required

#### Intel Galileo GEN1

* One [Intel Galileo GEN1](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/do-it-yourself/galileo-maker-quark-board.html) board with [firmware version 782 or above]( https://communities.intel.com/docs/DOC-21838 ).
* One Micro SD card. **NOTE:** We've tested the system with a [4 GB SanDisk Micro SDHC card] (http://www.sandisk.com/products/memory-cards/microsd/class4/) .
* One half PCI-E [Intel N-135 WiFi] ( http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/wireless-products/centrino-wireless-n-135.html ) card and a half-to-full height Mini PCI Express(PCI-E) Card Bracket Adapter to connect it to the board.
* One [WiFi antenna](http://www.amazon.com/Laptop-Wireless-PCI-E-Internal-Antenna/dp/B004ZHT2JE/ref=sr_1_7?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1389662898&sr=1-7&keywords=wireless+antenna+for+mini+pcie+wifi+card).
* One external 5V (>2A) power supply.

#### Intel Galileo GEN2

* One [Intel Galileo GEN2](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/do-it-yourself/galileo-maker-quark-board.html) board with [firmware version 1.0.2 or above]( https://communities.intel.com/docs/DOC-21838 ).
* One Micro SD card. **NOTE:** We've tested the system with a [4 GB SanDisk Micro SDHC card] (http://www.sandisk.com/products/memory-cards/microsd/class4/) .
* One half PCI-E [Intel N-135 WiFi] ( http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/wireless-products/centrino-wireless-n-135.html ) card and a half-to-full height Mini PCI Express(PCI-E) Card Bracket Adapter to connect it to the board.
* One [WiFi antenna](http://www.amazon.com/Laptop-Wireless-PCI-E-Internal-Antenna/dp/B004ZHT2JE/ref=sr_1_7?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1389662898&sr=1-7&keywords=wireless+antenna+for+mini+pcie+wifi+card).
* One external 12V (>1.5A) power supply.

### Software Installation for GEN1 & GEN2

1) Download the project's zip file from the [release page](https://github.com/IntelOpenDesign/ConnectAnyThing/releases). **NOTE:** For Galileo GEN1 use v0.2.2 and below. For GEN2 use v0.2.3 and above.

2) Unpack the file.

3) Make sure the [Micro SD card is FAT32 formatted]( http://www.wikihow.com/Format-an-SD-Card ).

4) Copy the entire content into the root directory of the Micro SD card. **NOTE:** Keep the file structure intact.

GEN1:
5) In the SD card unzip the image-full-clanton.zip file. **NOTE:** it should contain the image-full-clanton.ext3 file.

6) If successful, the Micro SD card's directory tree should look as follows:
* boot (directory)
* bzImage (file)
* core-image-minimal-initramfs-claton.cpio.gz (file)
* image-full-clanton.ext3 (file)
* image-full-clanton.zip (file) <- This file can be removed to free up space.

GEN2:
5,6) If successful, the Micro SD card's directory tree should look as follows:
* boot (directory)
* bzImage (file)
* core-image-minimal-initramfs-claton.cpio.gz (file)
* image-full-galileo-clanton.ext3 (file)
* image-full-galileo-clanton.zip (file) <- This file can be removed to free up space.

7) Put the Micro SD card in the Galileo board and power it up. **NOTE:** It could take up to 3 minutes for the board to boot-up.

8) On your mobile device or computer, connect to the "ConnectAnyThing" network. **NOTE:** If you don't see the network on your device, make sure your Galileo board has [firmware version 782 or above] ( https://communities.intel.com/docs/DOC-21838 ).

9) Start Chrome (34+) on your device, and in the address bar, type either: "cat", "cat.com", or "192.168.0.10".

10) If successful, you should see a Galileo board image and pin controls.

ENJOY...!!!

### Known Issues
* Connecting with an iPhone: Apple likes to protect you from Wi-Fi hotspots that are not connected to the internet (such as ConnectAnyThing.)  The first time you connect with an iPhone, go to settings ->WiFi -> choose ConnectAnyThing.  A pop up comes up that says “Log In”, hit “cancel.”  And your phone will disconnect from the network.  Join ConnectAnyThing again.  When you hit “Cancel” the second time, an option will come up that says “Connect without Internet.” Select this and you’re all set.

* Digital pins 0 (RX) and 1 (TX) are currently disabled to avoid RS-232 conflicts.

* Any short circuits on the Galileo board will cause it to reboot. This will break the websockets connection. Avoid placing the board on any conductive materials to prevent any short circuits.
